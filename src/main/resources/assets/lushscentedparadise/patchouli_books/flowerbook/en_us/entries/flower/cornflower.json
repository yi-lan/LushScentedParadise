      "text": "$(#60ceeb)$(l)【Azure of the Skies】$()$(br2)“A touch of sky blue in the wilderness, swaying gently like a whisper in the wind.”$(br2)The slender stems of the cornflower hold up porcelain-blue blossoms, with serrated petals encircling a golden core. Often growing in clusters across sunlit plains, its flowers are rich in natural pigments and were once used as a fabric dye by European farmers. When dried, the petals can be steeped into a tea that soothes eye fatigue."

Children weave its blossoms into rings, for it is said that wearing one grants the ability to foresee the weather for the next three days.”"
