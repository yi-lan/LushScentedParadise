Its particles purify toxic cave air, leading miners to call it a ‘natural air purifier.’ However, prolonged exposure to its spores may cause mild weightlessness hallucinations."

But when Jim tried to collect a spore sample, his boots lost traction, and he drifted like a drunken balloon straight into a stalactite… Fortunately, he fell just before impact. His backside, however, was not as lucky.”"
