When consumed raw, the flesh releases particles that distort space, causing the eater’s body to reappear elsewhere. It is said that Endermen rely on this fruit to traverse dimensions."

Upon drinking, muscle fibers briefly quantumize, allowing a punch to shatter obsidian. The milk also neutralizes the chorus fruit’s adverse effects.$(br2)End survival tip: Always keep a bucket of milk in your inventory—it can turn the void’s deadly gifts into divine power capable of tearing through enemy ranks."
