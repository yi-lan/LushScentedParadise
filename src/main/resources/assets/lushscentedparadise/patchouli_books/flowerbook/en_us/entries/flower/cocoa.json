Their pods, deep brown in color, encase fragrant and delicate seeds. Absorbing the rainforest’s humid air and scorching sunlight, they swell with vitality. When ground into a bitter yet intense drink, they are used to invoke courage and warmth."

      "text": "Cocoa beans primarily grow in jungle biomes, attaching to tree trunks. Their growth is a long process—starting as pale green pods, gradually turning golden, and finally maturing into deep brown. Once fully ripe, the pods can be harvested, and the beans scatter like nature’s sweet gift to the land."

Yet, moments later, warmth spread from my throat to my limbs, as if I were embraced by the fire itself.”"
